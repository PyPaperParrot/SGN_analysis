# SGN_analysis
This git repo was created for my Master's Term Paper in HSE. The topic is Analysis of Stochastic Gradient Descent for Deep
Neural Networks. The main attention in this research is paid to stochastic gradient noise (SGN) which distribution apparently affects model's behavior in optimization curve and allows it to escape narrow minimums.
